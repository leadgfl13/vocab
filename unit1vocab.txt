Homeostasis = Internal Balance
Independent Variable = The variable you control, goes on X axis
Dependent Variable = The variable that you measure, goes on Y axis
Cells = The basic structure of all living Things
Prokaryotic Cell = A simple cell, lacks organelles
Eukaryotic Cell = A complex cell with membrane bound organelles
DNA = Found in all cells, code for living Things
Cytoplasm = Fluid inside of Cells
Nucleus = Large organelle in Eukaryotic cells, controls the cells activities
Cell Membrane = The layer surrounding a cell, controls what goes in and out
Mitochondria = Organelle that creates energy for the cell in the form of ATP
Cell Wall = Found on the outside of plant and bacteria cells, used for protection
Experimental Group = This group receives the independent Variable
Control Group = This group does not receive the independent variable, acts as a base of measure
Hypothesis = A testable statement
Scientific Method = a method of questioning and reasoning that helps collect evidence to explain phenomena
Stimulus = any event, or thing that may cause a response
Theory = a collection of evidence that has been tested and supported
Controls = variables within an experiment that are kept the same across all groups
