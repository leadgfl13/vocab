# vocab

This is a basic vocabulary review program designed for students to master content.  

It is designed for 8 units, of which there are separate vocabulary files for each unit.

Using the kivy framework, this graphic userface allows students to select a unit, then choose whether to receive the word, or the definition.  Students can 
then type in their answer.  Once satisfied, students can select the reveal answer to show the actual answer.  The program will check the student answer against
the real answer, and if the student answer has a greater than 50 percent match, they receive one point in the score calculator in the bottom.

Students should be able to switche seamlessly between units, as well as switch between having to provide the vocabulary word, or the definition when given the word.
