Respiration = Process by which living things create ATP
Photosynthesis = Process by which plants convert energy from the sun into a stable form known as Glucose
Glucose = a form of stable energy, containing 6 carbon   C6 H12 06
ATP = Energy that our cells use, Adenosine Tri Phosphate
Mechanical Digestion = The physical act of breaking down food into smaller pieces
Autotroph = an organism that can make its own Food
Heterotroph = an organism that has to eat other organisms for nutrients
Aerobic Respiration = a type of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to create 38 ATP molecules from one Glucose
Anaerobic Respiration = a type of cellular respiration that does not use oxygen, creates 4 ATP molecules from one Glucose
Protein = a nutrient that is used to build tissues, act as enzymes, and provide many other functions for Cells
Lipids = A form of stored energy, also used to build cell membranes
Carbohydrates = a form of energy that the body consumes and breaks down into glucose to use in cellular Respiration
Lactic Acid Fermentation = a form of anaerobic respiration that produces lactic acid as a by product, bacteria create yogurt and cheese this way
Alcoholic Fermentation = a form of anaerobic respiration that produces alcohol as a by product, used by yeast in beer and wine making
Glcyolysis = the universal first step in breaking down Glucose into two pyruvate molecules during cellular respiration
Enzymes = a catalyst that is used during a chemical reaction but is not changed, the shape of an enzyme determines its function, a Protein
Amino Acids = small building blocks that make proteins
Catalyst = anything that speeds up a chemical reaction
Chemical Digestion = the breaking down of molecular bonds, uses an enzyme
Lactase = a type of enzyme that breaks down lactose
Lactose = a type of sugar found in milk
- ase = enzymes end with this, amylase, pectinase, lactase
- ose = sugars end with this, galactose,fructose, glucose
